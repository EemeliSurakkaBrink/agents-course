In 2017, I embarked on a journey into the world of web development by creating a website for a friend's emerging business. This experience ignited a passion that led me to earn a Bachelor's degree in Business Information Technology from Haaga-Helia University in Helsinki. My academic journey, coupled with a keen interest in technology, fostered a deep enthusiasm for both frontend and backend development.

What truly captivates me about software development is the moment of revelation—when the root cause of a bug is identified or the best approach to implementing a feature becomes clear. This passion for discovery and continuous learning drives my dedication to the field.

Transitioning from university to a professional software development career, I have honed my skills in JavaScript, utilizing its capabilities to create interactive and user-friendly web solutions. Currently, as a software consultant at Ordina, I leverage my practical experience in web development to provide results-oriented consulting services. I assist clients in identifying their technical requirements, selecting optimal tools and technologies, and aligning these choices with their business objectives.

I am dedicated to understanding and translating your vision into a functional, visually appealing web application. From conceptualization to execution, I am here to ensure your project not only meets but exceeds your expectations.
